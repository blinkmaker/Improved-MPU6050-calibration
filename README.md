# Improved MPU-6050 calibration

I have made some improvements to the original MPU-6050 calibration sketch by Luis Ródenas:
1. A check has been added if the MPU-6050 is not detected, so the sketch does not proceed to find the offsets.
2. The calibration offsets are printed out in a practical format so the results can be directly copied and pasted into the Arduino sketch.
3. Some general minor fixes and visual improvements.
